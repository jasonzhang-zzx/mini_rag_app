We aimed to develop and validate an artificial  intelligence (AI) system for standardised and reliable screening of cardiac amyloidosis-suggestive uptake and assess  its prognostic value, using a multinational database of ⁹⁹mTc-scintigraphy data across multiple tracers and scanners. Methods In this retrospective, international, multicentre, cross-tracer development and validation study, 16 241 patients  with 19 401 scans were included from nine centres: one hospital in Austria (consecutive recruitment Jan 4, 2010, to  Aug 19, 2020), five hospital sites in London, UK (consecutive recruitment Oct 1, 2014, to Sept 29, 2022), two centres in  China (selected scans from Jan 1, 2021, to Oct 31, 2022), and one centre in Italy (selected scans from Jan 1, 2011, to  May 23, 2023).",

Exclusion  criteria  were  image  acquisition  at  less  than  2  h  (⁹⁹mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic  acid,  ⁹⁹mTc-hydroxymethylene  diphosphonate, and ⁹⁹mTc-methylene diphosphonate) or less than 1 h (⁹⁹mTc-pyrophosphate) after tracer injection and if patients’ imaging and clinical data could not be linked. Ground truth annotation was derived from centralised core lab consensus reading of at least three independent experts (CN, TT-W, and JN). An AI system for detection of cardiac  amyloidosis-associated  high-grade  cardiac  tracer  uptake  was  developed  using  data  from  one  centre  (Austria)  and  independently validated in the remaining centres. A multicase, multireader study and a medical algorithmic audit  were conducted to assess clinician performance compared with AI and to evaluate and correct failure modes. The  system’s  prognostic  value  in  predicting  mortality  was  tested  in  the  consecutively  recruited  cohorts  using  cox  proportional hazards models for each cohort individually and for the combined cohorts. Findings The prevalence of cases positive for cardiac amyloidosis-suggestive uptake was 142 (2%) of 9176 patients in  the Austrian, 125 (2%) of 6763 patients in the UK, 63 (62%) of 102 patients in the Chinese, and 103 (52%) of 200  patients in the Italian cohorts.

The studies investigated a small number of  tracers and validated their findings on non-consecutively  sampled patients originating from one or multiple centres  within one country.

To ensure the clinical value of these  systems for the screening of cardiac amyloidosis, validation on  consecutively sampled real-world data is required. Added value of this study To our knowledge, this international study of 16 241 patients is  the largest study yet for the development and validation of an only  modality  to  reliably  diagnose  cardiac  amyloidosis;  however,  this  method  has  associated  inherent  risks. Scintigraphy with amyloid-avid tracers has revol utionised  the diagnostic pathway, because intense cardiac uptake in  the  absence  of  pathological  light  chains  now  enables  a  non-biopsy diagnosis of ATTR-cardiac amyloidosis.2 Other  causes of intense cardiac uptake are much less common  and  include  AL-cardiac  amyloidosis  as  well  as  very  rare  subtypes  of  cardiac  amyloidosis,3  whereas  non-cardiac  amyloidosis related conditions are extremely scarce. This  scenario  makes  high-grade  cardiac  uptake  a  reliable  feature for the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. indications The  spectrum  of  referral for  ⁹⁹mTc  scintigraphy is broad, whereby the specific query for the  presence  of  abnormal  cardiac  uptake  only  makes  out  a  minority of referrals.4 Hence, cardiac uptake might occur  as  an  incidental  finding  and  confront  physicians  from  non-cardiac  specialties.",

It is the first study validating all  available scintigraphy tracers currently used in clinical practice  and capable of indicating presence of cardiac amyloidosis.

    "text": "Importantly,  our  system  also  conveyed  strong  prog nostic information. A positive cardiac amyloid marker, as  predicted by the AI system, was independently associated  with an increased mortality hazard in the overall cohort,  and  in  the  Austrian  and  UK  cohorts  separately. These  results  are  remarkable  considering  the  high  prevalence  of  cancer  in  this  all-comer  cohort  with  associated  high  mortality rates. These findings highlight the progressive  disease  nature  of  cardiac  amyloidosis,  which  can  be  tackled  nowadays  with  already  available  and  emerging  treatment  options.5,21–23  In  light  of  these  new  therapies,  early  disease  recognition  and  efficient  management  pathways  will  become  increasingly  important  patient  care components, which might be effectively streamlined  with the help of AI-based systems. trigger Embedding  the  developed  system  into  the  clinical  workflow  might  be  useful  on  different  levels. First,  incorporating the AI system as an in-line tool, which sits  directly on the scanning software and has the ability for  immediate  image  analysis  during  image  acquisition,  would  enable  automated  real-time  detection  of  cardiac  amyloidosis-suggestive  uptake  and  further  diagnostic  steps,  such  as  the  necessity  of  performing additional  SPECT-CT. Automated  activation  of  manage ment  pathways  such  as  notification  of  or  referral  to  dedicated  specialist  centres  could  help  reduce  time  to  diagnosis and to treatment initiation. This time reduction  could be of particular importance for outpatient imaging  centres where cardiology expertise might be limited and  referral  pathways  less  well  established.",

Second,  the  system can be applied for the retrospective screening of  cohorts  to  identify  patients  requiring  dedicated  cardiac  amyloidosis care or to recruit subjects for clinical studies. Due  to  the  low  prevalence  of  ATTR-associated  cardiac  amyloidosis,  large  amounts  of  imaging  data  must  be  screened  in  a  time-consuming  manual  procedure  to  derive  sufficiently  large  cohorts  for  expressive  clinical  studies. Using  the  automated  prediction  system,  hundreds  of  patients  can  be  assessed  for  ATTR-cardiac  amyloidosis  few  seconds. Objectifying  and  standardising  detection  of  patients  with  cardiac  amyloidosis-suggestive  uptake  would  also  allow  the  screening of larger populations at high-risk, as recently  recommended.24–26 in  a Several limitations  of the  present  study  merit comment,  including  the  relatively  small  and  nonconsecutively  acquired  cohort  of  ⁹⁹mTc-PYP  and  ⁹⁹mTc HMDP  scans. Still,  the  results  derived  from  this  data  provide a proof-of-concept allowing for a first estimation the system  and  clinical of  the  AI  system’s  applicability  to  screen  for  cardiac amyloidosis-suggestive  uptake  in  ⁹⁹mTc-PYP  and  ⁹⁹mTc HMDP  scans. Further,  the  ground  truth  for  this  study  was  based  on  the  clinical  standard  of  visual  image  assessment. Despite  thorough  annotation  by  multiple  readers,  occasional  misjudgement  cannot  be  ruled  out. Ground  truth  based  on  histology  from  heart  biopsies and SPECT-CT would be ideal, especially for the  comparison  of  AI  reader  performance.",

Ground  truth  based  on  histology  from  heart  biopsies and SPECT-CT would be ideal, especially for the  comparison  of  AI  reader  performance. However, (1) retrieving biopsy results for a  cohort of the present size is unrealistic, and (2) additional  SPECT-CT  of  the  chest  is  not  routinely  performed  (especially  in  non-cardiac  referrals),  and  the  results  of  the  present  study  therefore  reflect  real-life  conditions,  routine. which  makes  Additionally,  grade-1  uptake  was  defined  as  negative  in  the present study. As detailed earlier, grade 1 might also  represent  cardiac  amyloidosis,  and  future  refinements  of AI-based cardiac amyloidosis detection will therefore  need  to  focus  on  differentiating  benign  causes  (eg, residual  blood  pool  activity)  from  cardiac  amyloidosis associated  uptake. This  diff erentiation  will  require  planar scans coupled with SPECT-CT and cardiac biopsy  to  define  true  cardiac  amyloidosis.
